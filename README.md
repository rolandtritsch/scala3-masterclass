# The Scala3 Masterclass

This repo maintains all of the exercises.

And it also creates a test-bed for my EMACS based software development
environment.

## Running exercises

- `mill hello3.test`
- `mill hello3.run`

## Software-Development Flow

- Write/Generate empty test(s) and an empty implementation that
  compiles, but does not do anything
- Write the test(s)
  - start with property based testing
  - add other tests, if necessary
- (Iteratively) Flesh out the implementation (until complete)
- Use the REPL (and/or workbooks and/or Github-Copilot) to
  interactively develop lines/blockes of code
- Setup Github Actions to compile and test the code

## Software-Development Tools and Frameworks

- Mill (not SBT)
- Github-Copilot
- Scala Test
- Scala Code Coverage
- Using Scala Doc (for A&D documentation) 
- Formatter
- Linter
- Logging
- Github-Actions
- (Coding) Conventions
